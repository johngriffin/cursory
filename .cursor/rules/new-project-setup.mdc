        # New Project Setup Process

        ## 1. Check Product Requirements Document
        - Verify spec/prd.md exists and contains complete requirements
        - Create spec directory if it doesn't exist
        - If PRD is missing, help the user to create one otherwise we can't proceed

        ## 2. Define Technical Architecture
        - Create .cursor/rules/tech-architecture.mdc to define:
          - Programming languages
          - Frameworks/libraries
          - Database choices
          - Infrastructure requirements
          - Design patterns to follow

        ## 3. Initialize Git Repository
        - Create a new git repository if one doesn't exist
        - Add a proper .gitignore file for the chosen tech stack
        - Make an initial commit

        ## 4. Task Breakdown
        - Break down the PRD into logical tasks/features
        - Save tasks in spec/tasks.md with prioritization
        - Assign task IDs and estimated complexity/time
        
        ## 5. Discovery Phase (First Task)
        - Create spec/task-001-discovery.md as the first task
        - List explicit assumptions to validate, including:
          - Required package availability and compatibility
          - Technical feasibility assessment
          - Performance considerations
          - Security requirements
        - Document research areas requiring web searches
        - Create proof-of-concept code for critical components
        - Do not do any more than is necessary
        
        ## 6. Task Completion Process
        - When a task is completed:
          - Create spec/task-XXX-completed.md documenting the implementation
          - Document any deviations from the original plan
          - Make a git commit with a detailed message
          - Update tasks.md to reflect progress
        
        ## 7. Project Organization
        - Maintain clean project structure according to best practices
        - Document architecture decisions in spec/architecture-decisions.md
        - Keep a running log of challenges and solutions
  examples:
    - input: "I want to start a new project for a web application"
      output: "Let's begin by checking if we have a PRD at spec/prd.md, then define the technical architecture, initialize git, and break down the tasks with a focus on an initial discovery phase."
    - input: "Create a new website project"
      output: "I'll help you set up a new website project following our structured approach: verifying/creating the PRD, defining architecture in tech-architecture.mdc, setting up git, breaking down tasks, and starting with a discovery phase."
